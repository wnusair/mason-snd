## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### STEP 1: Download the Current Roster

1. Navigate to the roster view page:
   ```
   Rosters ‚Üí View Roster ‚Üí "Princeton Classic Roster"
   ```

2. Click the **"Download"** button (green button in top right)

3. Excel file downloads: `roster_Princeton_Classic_20250106_143022.xlsx`

### STEP 2: Open and Review the Excel File

The file contains 3+ sheets:

#### **Sheet 1: "Judges"**
```
Judge Name       | Child          | Event              | Category | Number People Bringing | Judge ID | Child ID | Event ID
Mrs. Johnson     | Emily Johnson  | Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | 2                      | 15       | 23       | 3
Mr. Williams     | Alex Williams  | Policy Debate      | PF       | 4                      | 22       | 31       | 5
```

#### **Sheet 2: "Rank View"** ‚≠ê PRIMARY SHEET FOR COMPETITORS
```
Rank | Competitor Name | Partner | Weighted Points | Event              | Category | Status | User ID | Partner ID | Event ID
1    | John Smyth      |         | 450             | Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | Active | 41      |            | 3
2    | Sarah Martinez  |         | 425             | Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | Active | 38      |            | 3
3    | David Lee       |         | 400             | Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | Active | 52      |            | 3
```

#### **Sheet 3: "Lincoln Douglas"** (Event-specific sheet)
```
Event              | Category | Rank | Competitor    | Partner | Weighted Points | User ID | Event ID
Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | 1    | John Smyth    |         | 450             | 41      | 3
Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | 2    | Sarah Martinez|         | 425             | 38      | 3
```

### STEP 3: Make Your Edits

#### **Fix 1: Correct the Misspelled Name**
In "Rank View" sheet, Row 2:
```diff
- Rank | Competitor Name | User ID
- 1    | John Smyth      | 41      <- Typo in last name

+ 1    | John Smith      | 41      <- Fixed (keep User ID!)
```

**What happens**: Because User ID 41 is still there, the system knows it's the same person. The corrected name is just for display.

#### **Fix 2: Swap Rankings (Make Sarah #1, John #2)**

**Option A: Swap the User IDs** (Recommended)
```diff
In "Rank View" sheet:
- Rank | Competitor Name | User ID
- 1    | John Smith      | 41
- 2    | Sarah Martinez  | 38

+ 1    | Sarah Martinez  | 38      <- Swapped User ID
+ 2    | John Smith      | 41      <- Swapped User ID
```

**Option B: Reorder the rows**
```diff
Cut row 2 (Sarah Martinez) and insert above row 1
Result:
+ Rank | Competitor Name | User ID
+ 1    | Sarah Martinez  | 38      <- Now first
+ 2    | John Smith      | 41      <- Now second
```

#### **Fix 3: Add a New Judge**

In "Judges" sheet, add a new row:
```diff
+ Judge Name       | Child         | Event              | Category | Number People Bringing | Judge ID | Child ID | Event ID
+ Mrs. Thompson    | Mark Thompson | Lincoln Douglas    | LD       | 2                      | 67       | 71       | 3
```

**Tips**: 
- If you know the Judge ID, use it
- If not, just put the name and leave Judge ID blank (system will search by name)
- Same for Child ID

#### **Fix 4: Remove a Competitor**

In "Rank View" sheet:
```diff
- Delete row 3 (David Lee)
```
Just delete the entire row. That person won't be in the roster anymore.

### STEP 4: Save the Excel File

Save the file (keep the same name or rename it):
```
roster_Princeton_Classic_UPDATED.xlsx
```

### STEP 5: Upload the Updated Roster

1. Navigate to Upload Roster page:
   ```
   Rosters ‚Üí Upload Roster
   ```

2. Select upload mode:
   ```
   ‚òëÔ∏è Update Existing Roster  (NOT "Create New Roster")
   ```

3. Select the roster to update:
   ```
   Dropdown: "Princeton Classic Roster (2025-01-06)"
   ```

4. Upload your file:
   ```
   Click "Choose File" ‚Üí Select "roster_Princeton_Classic_UPDATED.xlsx"
   ```

5. Click **"Upload Roster"**

### STEP 6: Review the Results

After upload, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Roster 'Princeton Classic Roster' updated successfully! 
   Added 3 competitors and 3 judges. 0 warnings.
```

Or with warnings:
```
‚úÖ Roster 'Princeton Classic Roster' updated successfully! 
   Added 3 competitors and 3 judges. 1 warnings.

‚ö†Ô∏è Row 15 in Rank View: Could not find user 'Unknown Person'
```

### STEP 7: Verify Changes

Navigate back to the roster view:
```
Rosters ‚Üí View Roster ‚Üí "Princeton Classic Roster"
```

Verify:
- ‚úÖ John Smith's name is spelled correctly
- ‚úÖ Sarah Martinez is now ranked #1
- ‚úÖ Mrs. Thompson is added as a judge
- ‚úÖ David Lee is removed

## Common Mistakes & Solutions

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Editing Event View Instead of Rank View
**Problem**: Changes in event-specific sheets are ignored.
**Solution**: Always edit the "Rank View" sheet for competitor changes.

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Deleting User IDs When Just Fixing Names
**Problem**: System can't find the person, treats it as a new entry.
**Solution**: Keep User ID intact when fixing spelling/typos.

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Using "Create New Roster" for Updates
**Problem**: Creates a duplicate instead of updating.
**Solution**: Use "Update Existing Roster" mode.

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Manually Changing Event IDs
**Problem**: Might mismatch events.
**Solution**: Let the system handle Event IDs automatically.

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do's
- ‚úÖ **Keep User IDs** when you want the same person
- ‚úÖ **Edit Rank View** for competitor changes
- ‚úÖ **Sort/filter in Excel** for easier editing
- ‚úÖ **Save backups** before major changes
- ‚úÖ **Check warnings** after upload

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't edit Event View sheets (use Rank View)
- ‚ùå Don't manually change Weighted Points (read-only)
- ‚ùå Don't forget to select "Update Existing Roster"
- ‚ùå Don't upload .csv files (must be .xlsx)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Could not find user 'Jane Doe'"

**Cause**: No user named "Jane Doe" in database.

**Solutions**:
1. Check spelling: "Jane Doe" vs "Jane  Doe" (extra space)
2. Check if user exists in system
3. Use User ID instead of name
4. Create user first, then add to roster

### Issue: Upload seems to work but nothing changed

**Cause**: Uploaded to wrong roster or used "Create New" instead of "Update"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you selected the correct roster in dropdown
2. Confirm "Update Existing Roster" was selected
3. Check if a new roster was created instead

### Issue: Ranks are all wrong after upload

**Cause**: Rows were reordered but ranks weren't updated

**Solutions**:
- Ranks are auto-calculated from row order
- Ensure rows are in the order you want
- The "Rank" column in spreadsheet is for reference only

### Issue: Partner information is lost

**Cause**: Partner ID was deleted or incorrect

**Solutions**:
- Keep Partner ID column intact
- If adding new partners, include their User ID
- Partners must both be in the same event
