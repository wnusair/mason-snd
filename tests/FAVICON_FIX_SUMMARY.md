# Favicon Implementation Summary

## What was fixed:

1. **Corrected the favicon route path calculation** - The route was looking in the wrong directory. Fixed to properly navigate from `mason_snd/blueprints/main/main.py` to `mason_snd/static/`.

2. **Added multiple favicon routes** - Now handles both `/favicon.ico` and `/favicon` requests.

3. **Enhanced caching headers** - Added proper cache control headers to ensure the favicon is cached by browsers for better performance.

4. **Standardized favicon references** - All templates now use the same `{{ url_for('main.favicon') }}` approach for consistency.

5. **Added comprehensive favicon tags** - Multiple link tags for maximum browser compatibility:
   - `rel="icon"` with size specification
   - `rel="shortcut icon"` for older browsers
   - `rel="apple-touch-icon"` for iOS devices
   - `msapplication-TileImage` for Windows tiles

## To ensure the favicon shows up immediately:

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: 
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Firefox: Ctrl + F5
   - Safari: Cmd + Shift + R

2. **Clear browser cache** if needed

3. **Check developer tools**: Open browser dev tools (F12) and go to Network tab to verify the favicon is being loaded successfully

## Routes now available:
- `/favicon.ico` - Standard favicon route
- `/favicon` - Alternative favicon route

Both routes serve the same `icon.png` file from the static directory with proper caching headers.
