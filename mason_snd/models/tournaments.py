"""Tournament Models - Tournament management and participation tracking.

Defines tournaments, custom registration forms, signups, attendance tracking,
performance results, judge commitments, and partner pairings.

Key Models:
    Tournament: Tournament event details and deadlines
    Form_Fields: Custom registration form fields
    Form_Responses: User responses to registration forms
    Tournament_Signups: User registrations for tournaments
    Tournaments_Attended: Attendance tracking
    Tournament_Performance: Competition results and rankings
    Tournament_Judges: Judge commitment tracking
    Tournament_Partners: Partner pairings for partner events

Tournament Lifecycle:
    1. Tournament created with details and deadlines
    2. Custom form fields defined (if needed)
    3. Users sign up (Tournament_Signups, Form_Responses)
    4. Rosters generated from signups
    5. Tournament occurs
    6. Results submitted (Tournament_Performance)
    7. Attendance marked (Tournaments_Attended)

Custom Forms:
    - Dynamic form fields per tournament
    - Various field types (text, select, checkbox, etc.)
    - Required/optional fields
    - User responses tracked separately

    Tracks which judges are committed to judge for which children at specific
    tournaments and events. Separate from general Judges relationship (which
    is permanent), this tracks per-tournament commitments.
    
    Purpose:
        - Track judge commitments per tournament
        - Link judges to children for specific events
        - Confirm judge acceptance of commitment
        - Enable roster generation with judge assignments
        - Ensure sufficient judge coverage
    
    Relationship Types:
        Judges table (models/auth.py):
            - Permanent parent-child relationship
            - General judge availability
            - Background check status
        
        Tournament_Judges (this model):
            - Specific tournament commitment
            - Per-event assignment
            - Accepted/pending status
    
    Acceptance Tracking:
        accepted field:
            - False: Judge commitment pending acceptance (default)
            - True: Judge confirmed they will judge
        
        Purpose:
            - Track judge confirmation status
            - Prevent assuming unconfirmed judges
            - Enable reminder system for pending acceptances
    
    Columns:
        id: Primary key
        accepted: Boolean indicating judge confirmed (default False)
        judge_id: Judge user (foreign key to User)
        child_id: Child/competitor user (foreign key to User)
        tournament_id: Tournament context (foreign key to Tournament)
        event_id: Event being judged (foreign key to Event, nullable)
    
    Relationships:
        judge: Judge user object (backref: tournament_judges_judge)
        child: Child user object (backref: tournament_judges_child)
        tournament: Tournament object (backref: tournament_judges)
        event: Event object (backref: tournament_judges)
    
    Workflow:
        Signup:
            1. Child signs up for tournament (Tournament_Signups)
            2. Child selects judge to bring (from Judges relationships)
            3. Tournament_Judges entry created (accepted=False)
            4. Judge notified of commitment
        
        Acceptance:
            5. Judge accepts or declines commitment
            6. If accepted: accepted=True
            7. If declined: Entry deleted or marked differently
        
        Roster generation:
            8. Query accepted judges (accepted=True)
            9. Assign competitors to judges
            10. Generate roster with judge coverage
    
    Usage:
        Admin queries:
            - Find judges for tournament/event
            - Check acceptance status
            - Send reminders to unaccepted judges
        
        Roster generation:
            - Filter accepted=True
            - Count judges per child
            - Ensure minimum judge coverage
    
    Validation:
        - Judge must exist in Judges table (parent-child relationship)
        - Child must be signed up for same tournament/event
        - One judge per child per event (typically)
    
    Note:
        event_id nullable for tournament-wide judge commitments vs.
        event-specific assignments.
