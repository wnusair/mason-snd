"""Authentication and User Models - Core user system with relationships.

Defines user accounts, ghost accounts, parent-child relationships (Judges),
published roster notifications, and roster penalty tracking. Central to all
application functionality.

Key Models:
    User: Core user account (members, parents, children, admins)
    Judges: Parent-child relationship tracking
    User_Published_Rosters: Roster publication notifications
    Roster_Penalty_Entries: Penalty tracking for rosters (+1 indicators)

User Types:
    - Members: Regular users (role=0)
    - Event Leaders: Event managers (role=1)
    - Chairs+: Full admins (role=2+)
    - Parents: Users with is_parent=True
    - Children: Users with is_parent=False
    - Ghost Accounts: Unclaimed accounts (account_claimed=False)

Relationship System:
    - Parents linked to children via Judges table
    - Enables profile access across family members
    - Supports judge commitments for tournaments
    - Handles emergency contact information
