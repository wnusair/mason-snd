"""Event Models - Competition events and effort scoring system.

Defines speech and debate events (LD, PF, Extemp, etc.), event leadership,
user participation tracking, and effort scoring for practice/preparation.

Key Models:
    Event: Competition event definitions (LD, PF, Impromptu, etc.)
    Event_Leader: Event leadership assignments (ELs)
    User_Event: User participation in events (active membership)
    Effort_Score: Practice/preparation effort scoring by event leaders

Event System:
    - Events represent competition categories (LD, PF, Extemp, Oratory, etc.)
    - Users join events (User_Event) to participate
    - Event Leaders (ELs) manage events and score effort
    - Effort scores track practice/preparation (not competition results)

Event Types:
    - Speech events (event_type=0): Oratory, Impromptu, Extemp, etc.
    - LD debate (event_type=1): Lincoln-Douglas debate
    - PF debate (event_type=2): Public Forum debate
    - Partner events (is_partner_event=True): PF, Policy, Duo Interp

Effort Scoring:
    - Event leaders score member effort/preparation
    - Scores contribute to weighted metrics
    - Separate from tournament performance results
    - Encourages practice and team participation
