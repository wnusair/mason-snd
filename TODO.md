# Ultimate Testing Dashboard
Currently I do not have any tests which is very bad for a production app like my own.

**What you need to create:**
- testing files that can be run via commands
- a testing dashbord that can run tests and show a success rate and what has failed without crashing the website
- a page that lets you create a clone of the database and run tests that i want

## Tests that I want to be able to run on the dashboard

- create mock tournament and register users and their parents as judges
- download and upload roster feature should work
- event creation and people joining and leaving
    - should be able to see rankings from tournaments simulate drops and show the full metrics dashboard using this mock data

Simulated path:
I decide to enter testing mode and a cloned database is made automatically that all changes happen to
I decide to create a fake event and have people join it
I then decide to create another fake event and have people join it (should be different people cant be part of both unless there are more events than children/competators)
Next, I create a fake tournament and download the autogenerated roster, make my changes in the spreadsheet and upload the new one.
I then pres the end tournament button which simulates the tournament and gives everybody varying scores.
I then enter the metrics overview where i can se the metrics overview for the general team and the /my_metrics view for a user of my choice.

## Terminal Unit Tests
I dont want to go into detail about what I want you to make because there are so many routes and functions in the website. as a result, it is your job to look through every single route and create tests that can be run via a command for the most critical functions (~30 should be good)

## Web View Unit Tests
This view should basically run everything from the terminal view but have a nice display

all tests should go in the 'UNIT_TEST' folder.


### Important: make sure all this data is removed and DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PRODUCTION DATABASE IN ANY WAY
